This tool gathers anonymous data about your wiki and allows you to send it back
to the DokuWiki developers. This helps them to understand them how DokuWiki is
used by its users and makes sure future development decisions are backed up by
real world usage statistics.

You are encouraged to repeat this step from time to time to keep developers
informed when your wiki grows. Your repeated data sets will be identified by an
anonymous ID.

Data collected contains information like your DokuWiki version, the number and
size of your pages and files, installed plugins and information about your PHP
install.

The raw data that will be send is shown below. Please use the "Send Data" button
to transfer the information.
