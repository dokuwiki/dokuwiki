===== Bulk User Import =====

Requires a CSV file of users with at least four columns.
The columns must contain, in order: user-id, full name, email address and groups.
The CSV fields should be separated by commas (,) and strings delimited by quotation marks ("").  Backslash (\) can be used for escaping.
For an example of a suitable file, try the "Export Users" function above.  
Duplicate user-ids will be ignored.

A password will be generated and emailed to each successfully imported user.
