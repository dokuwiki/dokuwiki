# This workflow updates the list of deleted files based on the recent changes and creates a pull request.
# It compares the current master with the data/deleted.files file and cleans the file from any re-introduced files.
# It compares the current master with the stable branch and adds all deleted files to the data/deleted.files file
# unless they are already listed there or are excluded from the release archives (export-ignore in .gitattributes).
# Any additions are made to the top of the list with a single trailing line before the first "# removed on" line.
# Finally, the list of newly removed entries receives a header "# removed on $(date -I)" with the current ISO date.
