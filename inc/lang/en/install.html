<p>This page assists in the first time installation and configuration of <a href="http://dokuwiki.org">EasyWiki</a>. More info on this installer is available on it's own <a href="http://dokuwiki.org/installer">documentation page</a>.</p>

<p>EasyWiki uses ordinary files for the storage of wiki pages and other information associated with those pages (e.g. images, search indexes, old revisions, etc).  In order to operate successfully EasyWiki <strong>must</strong> have write access to the directories that hold those files.  This installer is not capable of setting up directory permissions. That normally needs to be done directly on a command shell or if you are using hosting, through FTP or your hosting control panel (e.g. cPanel).</p>

<p>This installer will setup your EasyWiki configuration for <abbr title="access control list">ACL</abbr>, which in turn allows administrator login and access to EasyWiki's admin menu for installing plugins, managing users, managing access to wiki pages and alteration of configuration settings. It isn't required for EasyWiki to operate, however it will make EasyWiki easier to administer.</p>
