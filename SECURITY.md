# Security Policy

Security vulnerabilities can be reported for the current stable release (branch `stable`) and the `master` branch.

We try to fix vulnerabilites as fast as possible, but please keep in mind that this is a project run by volunteers. Depending on the severity we may release hotfixes for the current stable release or may simply incorporate the fix in the next proper release.

**This policy only applies to DokuWiki and the bundled plugins. Do not report issues about 3rd party plugins here.**
