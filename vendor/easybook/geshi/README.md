# GeSHi - Generic Syntax Highlighter #

This repository has been created just to be able to install GeSHi as a Composer
package. Technically it's a port of the GeSHi project code found on SourceForge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/geshi/

Differences from the official SourceForge repository:

  * 11/may/2014: added `sass.php` file to highlight Sass stylesheets.
  * 28/sep/2012: added `twig.php` file to highlight Twig templates.
